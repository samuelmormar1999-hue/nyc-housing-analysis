# NYC Housing Market – Summary Report

## Objective
This report summarizes the main findings from an analysis of housing transactions in New York City.  
The objective is to understand market activity, pricing levels, and structural differences across location categories using transaction data.

---

## Data Overview
The analysis is based on historical housing sales data, including information on:
- Sale prices
- Location categories (borough codes)
- Building characteristics and surface area

The dataset was cleaned and analyzed using Python for exploratory analysis and SQL for market-oriented queries.

## Key Findings

- **Housing prices are not uniformly inflated across the market.**  
  While high-value properties exist, most transactions are concentrated within moderate price ranges, indicating a heterogeneous but coherent housing market.

- **Queens (QN) and Brooklyn (BK) concentrate the highest transaction volumes.**  
  These locations account for a significantly larger share of housing sales, suggesting highly liquid and active residential markets.

- **Manhattan (MN) represents a high-value, low-volume market.**  
  Despite having fewer transactions, Manhattan shows the highest average housing prices, indicating a more exclusive market segment.

- **Bronx (BX) and Staten Island (SI) show lower activity and lower average prices.**  
  These markets present fewer transactions and more affordable price levels relative to other locations.

- **Clear disparities exist across cities in terms of price levels, price per square foot, and transaction volume**, highlighting the structural segmentation of the NYC housing market.

## Market Implications

- **Liquidity differs substantially across locations.**  
  High-volume markets such as Queens and Brooklyn may be more attractive for investors seeking faster turnover and market depth.

- **High-price, low-volume markets suggest exclusivity rather than broad accessibility.**  
  Manhattan’s profile reflects a premium market where value is concentrated in fewer transactions.

- **Affordability varies significantly by location category**, which has implications for housing policy, urban planning, and buyer decision-making.

## Limitations

- The analysis is based on historical transaction data and does not capture temporal trends or market dynamics over time.
- Socioeconomic variables (e.g., income levels, demographics) are not included and therefore affordability is inferred only from housing prices.
- Location categories are analyzed as defined in the dataset and may not fully align with official administrative boundaries.

## Conclusion
The NYC housing market is highly segmented, with distinct profiles across location categories.  
Differences in transaction volume and pricing levels suggest the coexistence of volume-driven markets and value-driven markets within the same metropolitan area, underscoring the complexity of housing dynamics in New York City.
